* High Level Language: Humar interact in languages called as high level language.

* Low Level Language: Computer only understand binary language or digital signal called as Low level language.

* Complier: A compiler convert a code from high level to low level but a compiler convert all the code in one go. Ex: If 5 lines are written in a code, so compiler will try to read the code in  all together and throws error if any.

* Interpreter: An interpreter does the same thing, convert a code from high level to low level but interpreter check the code line by line and show us the error in specific line only.

**Python Execution Environment**

* Take file.py as a source code which is a High level language
* This code goes to python compiler but this is interpreter, this just have a name compiler but in actual this works as a interpreter.
* After checking code line by line, convert this code into byte code often called as intermediate code. In C language we called byte code as object code. Here pyc is referred to python compiled version.
* This code convert at execution phase called as Python virtual machine (PVM) or Just in time (JIT) compiler. Inside the PVM the interpreter resides and works.
* At the end, PVM reads line by line of Byte code and converted into Machine understandable byte code and it is read by OS and processor gives result.

# Datatype in python

Anything we provide as input to the programming language, datatype is allocating memory space to these inputs.
